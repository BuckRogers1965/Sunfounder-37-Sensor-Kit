Sunfounder 37 Sensor Kit arduino sketches and documentation

And not just arduino, if you have other kits that will work
with this sensor kit, then we can accomodate that as well.

Intro
-----

  The kit comes with 37 parts mounted on small circuit boards.
  Construction seems to be good, but the markings on the parts
  are not always clear. Not everything is a sensor, there are
  many parts that are emitters. Still, a great bargain for the
  price and something that can teach and entertain for 
  months.
  
  Good luck!


Directory Map
-------------

The info and sketchs for each of the 37 kits are in directories 
that begin with an arbitrary number from 001 to 037 followed
by the name of the kit.

There is a picture with name of each of the items in the kit
entitled 35Sensor.jpg.  Evidently 2 sensors are missing from 
the picture list.  No guarantee that the name from the picture
corrisponds to the name of the folder.

There is a 37-1.pdf file that has a little info and sketches for
every project.  It appeared to translated from another language,
so it wasn't very clear.

AdditionalProjects folder will hold anything not related to
the 37 kit items. I threw several directories in here today
just to clean things up. No clue what they are.

library folder holds any required libraries that any of the kits
needs.  The idea is that maybe more than one kit can share a
library, instead of duplicating them again and again.

And finally, the SensorKitUnboxed is what my kit looked like
when I dumped it out after recieving it in 2013.

Excuse Section
--------------

I am in college right now, and taking 18 hours, so I will not have
much time to maintain this for now.  Hopefully in the near term I 
can graduate, get a job, get settled in, and finally be able to 
take the time to go through these projects one at a time and get
them all working right out of the box.  It took me months just to
put up these files in an easily downloaded and updated location.

ReadMe.md is this file.
